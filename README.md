# hello-world2
my 2nd hello-world repository
I am a budding developer, and I have a lot of ideas. I believe that as my coding skills get better each day, I will be able to accomplish some of the most amazing things in the world.
I respect and admire people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and more recently Mark Zukerberg, because they have a vision and they have the will to pursue them relentlessly. 
I am not a nerd, I like doing differnt sports and enjoy the outdoors and the sun when I get some money and free time.
Github is a great invention, I like it already, LOL...
